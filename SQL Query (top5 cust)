See Top 5 cust Excel file upload for results

/* There are 2 subqueries and a CTE in the SQL expression below. Both subqueries are part of the CTE.
The CTE selects a list of the top 5 customers, ordering them by total spend on Rockbuster rentals, from within the top 10 cities (subq1)  
that are within the top 10 countries (subq2), by number of customer. 
As a phrase, "which 5 customers from the top 10 cities by customer within our top 10 countries by customer, spend the most on our products?"

This CTE feeds into our main query with a left join with the Customers table. The result is a list of all countries with a count of total customers in that country, 
with an additional column counting the presence of customers from the Top 5 list. These are sorted to the top of the results.
