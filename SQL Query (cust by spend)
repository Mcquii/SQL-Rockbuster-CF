/* This query extracts a list of  customers, their city/country, and their total amount paid to Rockbuster from the database.
First a CTE is set up to select a list of the top 10 cities within the top 10 countries by count of customers. Subquery 1 provides the list of countries
to the CTE main query, which selects cities with country ID in the subquery extraction.

Then in the main query, we join payment information to sum the amount paid per user, and extract the top 5 users by amount paid from within the CTE list of cities.
